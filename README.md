## Abstract
The study addresses the challenges associated with fertilizer application decisions in crop cultivation. An analytical approach using large-scale data mining techniques is proposed to determine the optimal quantities of fertilizer required for an entire season, tailored to local contextual and geographic factors.

## Keywords
- Large-scale datasets
- Machine learning
- Decision-making process
- Fertilizer applications
- Nutrient application timeline
- Crop yield

## Research Highlights
- Analysis of the vital role of data analytics in monitoring fertilizer applications.
- Proposal of a solution to predict nutrient application by determining required fertilizer quantities.
- Examination of large-scale heterogeneous datasets in the context of the decision-making process.

## Methodology
The methodology involves:
- Handling large, heterogeneous datasets with missing values, noise, and outliers.
- Developing efficient algorithms for data preprocessing.
- Devising strategies to address machine learning model development issues such as biases or overfitting.
- Constructing nutrient application timelines based on subdivided datasets.
