This document presents the findings of a study on the application of machine learning to predict and recommend nutrient application timelines in smart agriculture. It aims to optimize fertilizer usage by considering various factors like weather conditions and soil characteristics, thus promoting cost-effective and environmentally friendly farming practices.

## Abstract
The study addresses the challenges associated with fertilizer application decisions in crop cultivation. An analytical approach using large-scale data mining techniques is proposed to determine the optimal quantities of fertilizer required for an entire season, tailored to local contextual and geographic factors.
